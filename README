This nifty little script will take either the RPM's that you specify on the
commandline, or the entire RPM database if none are specified, and output in
either a machine-readable comma separated form (with the -m option), or a more
human readable list what key was used to sign the RPM's.

This depends on the keys being imported into the RPM database. If they aren't,
then they are categorized as "Unknown key <keyid>". If packages are unsigned,
they are categorized as such. As an alternative the behavior for unknown keys,
with the -k option, you can specify a file that has a comma separated list of
keyid, description lines (a sample is included in this directory)

You can also provide the list of packages via stdin. To do this, use the -s switch,
and feed stdin the output of the following command:

rpm -q --qf '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}|%{DSAHEADER:pgpsig}\n' -a

On RHEL and Fedora <=10, use the %{DSAHEADER:pgpsig} as noted above. On Fedora
10 and above, use %{RSAHEADER:pgpsig} to obtain the same output.

If feeding the output from a non-local system, it may be deisrable to combine
this with the -k option in order to obtain meaningful output instead of
'unknwon key <keyid>' for every key not known on the local system
