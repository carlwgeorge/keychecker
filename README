This nifty little script will take either the RPM's that you specify on the
commandline, or the entire RPM database if none are specified, and output in
either a machine-readable comma separated form (with the -m option), or a more
human readable list what key was used to sign the RPM's.

This depends on the keys being imported into the RPM database. If they aren't,
then they are categorized as "Unknown key <keyid>". If packages are unsigned,
they are categorized as such. As an alternative the behavior for unknown keys,
with the -k option, you can specify a file that has a comma separated list of
keyid, description lines (a sample is included in this directory)
